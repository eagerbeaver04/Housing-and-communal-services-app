2. Support for monthly generation of service payment receipts for residents

4. Support for accepting payment for services using receipts (as if information from a bank)

 ## Generated reports
1. list of debtors (by type of service) indicating the debt as of the current date
2. Generating the text of a letter to debtors (from 2 to 5 months) with a request to repay the debt
3. Generating the text of a subpoena for debtors overdue for more than 6 months with service disconnection
